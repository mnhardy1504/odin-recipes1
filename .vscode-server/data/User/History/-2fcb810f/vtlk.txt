## UNIVERSAL CRAFTSMANSHIP
#### by, Montel Hardy

### Craftsmanship is an older term that we may think of as being exclusive to professionals who work with their hands. However, nearly any human job should have several people who have the accolade of "Craftsman". By comparing the role of an offensive coordinator, a musician, and a barber, I can prove that the principles of craftsmanship can be applied to many professions.

### A Craftsman can be described as any person who pushes their trade to new heights. This person doesn't have "reinvent the wheel" but they can take current technology and show you more things that it can accomplish. Craftsmanship starts with passion and taking pride in your work, building things that they are happy to own or show off at any time. Finally, craftsmen do the job to the best of their ability whether they are: working for  free, working for moderate pay, or working for higher than normal pay. Craftsmen enjoy the experience of working on their craft.

### Meticulus detail goes into the planning and execution of the game of football. Both offensive and defensive coordinators build schemes or strategies to put their players in positions to succeed. Building a scheme, building plays, and designing a practice to teach this to men or youth athletes requires craftsmanship principles. For example, football coaches spend hours studying opponents, studying their own players, and building ways to exploit the weaknesses of the opposition. This requires precision as every offense and defense is built to have as few deficiencies as possible and to make their deficiencies very tough to find. Therefore coaches must build plays that require blockers to create just enough space for position players, and players must align themselves in such a specific way and execute a play precisely as drawn to achieve success. Successful football coaches have to love what they do to be able to spend the amount of time and energy to be creative with utilizing their strengths and weaknesses. Craftsmanship has led to innovation in football such as: the flex defense, the spread offensive, or even the triple option. 

### A musician is also a craftsman in many ways. Given that many musicians aren't typically doing so for a salary, passio
n is what drives many of them to perform. Whether the musician is a singer or plays an instrument, to perform there are notes they have to hit, they all may hold the microphone or instrument a certain way, and most of all their music should have the aim of connecting them to their audience. The practice of using your craft and your passion for it to connect with the end user is a craftsmanship principle.
